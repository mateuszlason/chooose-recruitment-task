## Introduction

I chose Next.js to run this project since it provides easy routing and API.

## Getting Started

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to run this project.

With [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script), I set the node version to LTS so that pnpm can run without errors:

```
nvm install --lts
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Install packages:

```
pnpm i
```

then:

```
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
